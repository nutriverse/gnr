Description: The Global Nutrition Report's purpose is to produce a single,
    authoritative source on progress toward addressing critical gaps in the
    nutrition accountability framework, both at national and international
    levels. This is a companion package to the Global Nutrition Report primarily
    for accessing the data used in the report and to reproduce the data
    visualisation produced in the report. This package contains functions that
    allow users to interrogate the same data and produce customised charts and
    other visualisation products.
