<!-- badges: end -->

The Global Nutrition Report's purpose is to produce a single, authoritative source on progress toward addressing critical gaps in the nutrition accountability framework, both at national and international levels. This is a companion package to the Global Nutrition Report primarily for accessing the data used in the report and to reproduce the data visualisation produced in the report. This package contains functions that allow users to interrogate the same data and produce customised charts and other visualisation products.

## Installation

`gnr` is available via GitHub as follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nutriverse/gnr")
```
